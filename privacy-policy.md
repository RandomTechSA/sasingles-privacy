RandomTech, operates the SASingles mobile app. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve the App. This includes:

- **User-Provided Information:** Email address and authentication data (e.g., via Firebase Auth) for account creation and login.
- **Purchase Information:** Transaction details (e.g., product IDs like "likes_10_24h") processed through Google Play Billing. We do not store full payment details; Google handles this.
- **Usage Data:** Device information (e.g., IP address, device ID), app interactions (e.g., product views, purchases), and logs (via Firebase Firestore and Timber) for functionality and debugging.
- **No Location or Sensitive Data:** We do not collect precise location, camera, microphone, or contact data unless explicitly requested (none in current version).

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is not intended for children under 13, and we comply with COPPA by not targeting or soliciting data from minors.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for:

- Providing services: Authentication, processing in-app purchases (e.g., likes, chat keys, subscriptions), and storing user progress via Firebase.
- Improving the App: Analytics to fix bugs and enhance features (e.g., via Firebase).
- Compliance: Verifying purchases and preventing fraud via Google Play.
- No Marketing: We do not use data for ads or sharing with third parties for marketing.

## 3. Sharing Your Information

We share data only as needed:

- With Google (for billing and Play Store compliance; see Google's Privacy Policy).
- With Firebase (Google's service for auth and storage; data is encrypted and compliant with GDPR).
- For legal reasons: If required by law or to protect rights/safety.

We do not sell your data. Third parties (e.g., Google) have their own policies.

## 4. Data Security and Retention

We use reasonable security measures (e.g., Firebase encryption) to protect data. Retention: User data is kept as long as your account is active; purchases are acknowledged per Google policy. Delete inactive data after 24 months or upon request.
